    <p> <b>Roza is a biological researcher in a prominent microbiology laboratory. 
      Many bacterial species are not well studied and many more remain unknown to science. 
      Roza’s role is to discover and document these bacteria. In particular, Roza is interested in 
      bacterial species that have ability to synthesize proteins that taste like beef. Her lab has partnered 
      with “Improbable beef”, a food Startup, to research candidate species. Labs across the country have had 
      success in synthesizing meat from algae, fungi and microorganisms found on plant roots. 
      However, improbable beef is still searching for elusive bacteria that provides perfect taste. 
      Roza has a hypothesis that there's a microorganism that can supply the next best taste 
      and she believes it can be found quite close to home from bacteria found on the human body. 
      The human body is a source of thousands of types of bacteria and different parts of the body 
      harbor different species. Bacteria found in the gut are not the same species that are found on a 
      person's eyelashes for example. Furthermore, between individuals the bacterial species may vary even 
      in the same location. Roza hypothesizes that the ideal bacterial species to make synthetic beef may be 
      found in the belly button or at least in someone’s bellybutton. To test your hypothesis, Roza has sampled 
      the tables of people across the country to identify bacterial species that colonize our belly buttons. 
      Each person's identity is anonymous. They’ve instead been assigned an ID. This dashboard can be accessed by both 
      her research participants and fellow researchers. Those who participated in the study will 
      be able to visit this website select their ID numbers to see which bacterial species live in their navels. </b></p>
