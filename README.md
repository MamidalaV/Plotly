# Plotly

# BACKGROUND:
Roza is a biological researcher in a prominent microbiology laboratory. Many bacterial species are not well studied and many more remain unknown to science. Roza’s role is to discover and document these bacteria. In particular, Roza is interested in bacterial species that have ability to synthesize proteins that taste like beef. Her lab has partnered with “Improbable beef”, a food Startup, to research candidate species. Labs across the country have had success in synthesizing meat from algae, fungi and microorganisms found on plant roots. However, improbable beef is still searching for elusive bacteria that provides perfect taste. Roza has a hypothesis that there's a microorganism that can supply the next best taste and she believes it can be found quite close to home from bacteria found on the human body. The human body is a source of thousands of types of bacteria and different parts of the body harbor different species. Bacteria found in the gut are not the same species that are found on a person's eyelashes for example. Furthermore, between individuals the bacterial species may vary even in the same location. Roza hypothesizes that the ideal bacterial species to make synthetic beef may be found in the belly button or at least in someone’s bellybutton. To test your hypothesis, Roza has sampled the tables of people across the country to identify bacterial species that colonize our belly buttons. Each person's identity is anonymous. They’ve instead been assigned an ID. This dashboard can be accessed by both her research participants and fellow researchers. Those who participated in the study will be able to visit this website select their ID numbers to see which bacterial species live in their navels.

# PURPOSE:

The purpose of this project is to create a dashboard that users can use to find out the bateria cultures and other metadata, that can be used to synthesize Beef. 

# RESULTS:

The results are displayed in four sepearate sections for users to consume. The data within these charts is automatically displayed according to the sample ID that user selects.


#### Demographics Info:

Upon selecting the sample ID, the demographic information table displays the datapoints of the individual the ID belongs to.

#### Horizontal bar chart to display Top 10 bacteria cultures found per sample:

Along with the previous table, this bar chart updates to display the top 10 bacteria cultures found in each sample ID.

#### Bubble Chart:

The bubble chart at the bottom displays the OTU ID and it's correlation in terms of size using the value of each ID.

#### Gauge Meter:

Finally the gauge meter shows the number of washing cycles of the navel.

# CUSTOMIZATIONS:

The webpage is further customized by
1. Adding a background color.
2. Adding a Bsckground image to the jumotron.
3. Including a paragraph with the backfground of this project.
4. Adding description of each graph below it.
5. Making the webpage mobile responsive.
